# bixbyDevShowcase
My submission for the Bixby Developer Showcase October 2018

This capsule gets you the latest tweet from @SamsungMobile twitter handle and keeps you updated with the latest happenings at Samsung Mobile. It uses IFTTT to store the tweet in a google sheet and the tweet reader capsule makes an api call to fetch that tweet.

This is just a working prototype. Need to add more features like fetching tweets by @twitterHandles, better display layout, better NL model,...
